### 💡 My Mission  
As technology grows more automated, my goal is to **keep my voice authentic**. I don’t aim to be AI-perfect — I aim to be real. I want to build tools and systems that **enhance human experience**, not replace it.

### 📚 Currently Learning  
-  **Machine Learning Foundations**  
  Preparing for upcoming Coursera courses in ML and deep learning, with a focus on applying Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow to real-world datasets.

- **Capstone Project Building**  
  Collaborating on group projects, applying what I’ve learned to build health and finance-related applications.

- **Front-End Development Skills**  
  Improving HTML/CSS structure, layout design, and basic interactivity for portfolio and dashboard interfaces.

- Transitioning into **machine learning and deep learning** to build robust technical foundations  
- Actively working on **group capstone projects** to practice collaboration and problem-solving

### 🤝 Collaboration Style  
I bring **creative energy, structure, and confidence** to any team I work with. I value:
- Thoughtful communication  
- Inclusive problem-solving  
- Shared excitement in building something new  

When I work with others, I want us to feel like **creators**, not just coders.

### 🌿 Fun Fact  
I’ve always had a deep love for nature. Hiking, listening to birds, and sitting near flowing water keeps me grounded and creatively inspired. **Nature is my reset button.**
