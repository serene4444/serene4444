- 👋 Hi, I’m Serene Plummer. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of North Texas, specializing in Python and Machine Learning with Data Analytics. 
- 👀 I’m interested in preserving the authenticity of human connection and creativity as AI becomes increasingly integrated into education and daily life. My goal is to keep my voice true to myself, not an AI-polished version. Perfection does not mean inauthenticity.   
- 🌱 I’m currently building a solid foundation in Python programming while also learning Excel to support data-related tasks. I’m transitioning into data visualization in the summer of 2025, followed by machine learning and deep learning to strengthen my technical skills for internships. Everything I'm learning is geared toward building my confidence and security in my capabilities, not only as a Computer Science student, but as an architect and an engineer of data.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate more on group capstone projects as I progress in my studies. In team settings, I always promote a collaborative and communicative approach. When I have a unique idea, I want others to share my excitement about building something together. As a team member, my role is to foster creativity, build mutual confidence, and ensure that everyone feels empowered to contribute meaningfully.
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is sereneplmr@gmail.com . I'm always looking forward to connecting and collaborating with new individuals.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've always had a deep love for nature since I was young. I grew up surrounded by forests and made it a point to go on hikes whenever I could. After a busy week, spending time in nature always leaves me feeling refreshed and calm. Sitting alone on a trail, with only the sounds of birds, flowing water, and the wind, provides me with a sense of comfort and creative inspiration. From mental clarity to just a good exercise, I love being one with Mother Nature.
